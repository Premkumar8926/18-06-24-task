    <h1>Understanding Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
        JavaScript, as a versatile and powerful language for web development, relies heavily on objects to store and manipulate data. Objects in JavaScript are dynamic collections of properties, each having a key-value pair where the key is always a string (or symbol) and the value can be of any data type, including other objects or functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Objects in JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
        In JavaScript, objects can be defined using object literals or constructed using constructors. They are versatile and allow for complex data structures to be represented easily.
    </p>

    <h2>Internal Representation</h2>

    <p>
        Internally, JavaScript engines use different techniques to represent objects. Objects are typically stored as hash tables (or hash maps), where each property of the object is stored with its key mapped to its value. This allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of properties.
    </p>

    <h2>Properties and Methods</h2>

    <p>
        Properties of objects in JavaScript can be accessed using dot notation (e.g., <code>object.property</code>) or bracket notation (e.g., <code>object['property']</code>). Objects can also have methods, which are functions stored as object properties.
    </p>

    <h2>Prototypes and Inheritance</h2>

    <p>
        JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes. Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototype chain, enabling code reusability and object-oriented programming concepts.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <pre>
        <code>
            // Example of defining an object
            let person = {
                name: 'John Doe',
                age: 30,
                greet: function() {
                    return 'Hello, my name is ' + this.name;
                }
            };

            // Accessing object properties and methods
            console.log(person.name); // Output: John Doe
            console.log(person.greet()); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        Understanding how objects are represented internally in JavaScript helps developers leverage its capabilities effectively. Objects serve as fundamental building blocks in JavaScript, enabling developers to create robust and scalable applications.
